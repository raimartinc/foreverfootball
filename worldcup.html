                fullHighlight: "Brazil’s footballing saga is a vibrant tapestry of samba, skill, and unmatched World Cup supremacy, their five titles and nine Copa Américas etching them as the sport’s gold standard.<p> The journey began in 1958 in Sweden, where a 17-year-old Pelé burst onto the global stage. After a shaky start, Brazil unleashed their 4-2-4 formation, with Pelé scoring twice in a 5-2 final rout of the hosts—his second a lobbed masterpiece—Garrincha dazzling, and Vavá adding grit, ending a European stronghold with flair that still echoes.<p> In 1962 Chile, Pelé’s injury early against Czechoslovakia tested their depth, but Garrincha rose as the magician, his dribbling dismantling defenses. A 3-1 final win over the Czechs, with goals from Amarildo, Zito, and Vavá, showcased Brazil’s resilience, retaining the Jules Rimet Trophy under Aymoré Moreira’s steady hand.<p> The 1970 Mexico triumph is their magnum opus: a Technicolor dream where Pelé, Jairzinho, and Rivelino painted masterpieces—Jairzinho scoring in every match, Pelé’s dummy against Uruguay a moment of genius, and Carlos Alberto’s thunderous fourth in a 4-1 final demolition of Italy sealing a legacy of total football.<p> After a 24-year drought, 1994 in the USA brought redemption under Carlos Alberto Parreira’s pragmatic reign. Romário and Bebeto’s partnership shone, navigating a tough Italy side in the final. A 0-0 draw led to penalties, where Roberto Baggio’s miss—skying it over the bar—handed Brazil a 3-2 shootout win, a triumph of grit over their usual artistry.<p> The 2002 South Korea/Japan title was Ronaldo’s resurrection: after the 1998 collapse, he netted eight goals, including both in a 2-0 final over Germany—his first a poacher’s strike, the second a clinical finish—proving Brazil’s depth with Ronaldinho and Rivaldo sparkling.<p> Memorable second places scar the soul: 1950’s Maracanazo, where Uruguay’s 2-1 upset in front of 200,000 at the Maracaná —Schiaffino and Ghiggia silencing the masses— remains a national trauma.<p> In 1998, France’s 3-0 final thrashing, with Zidane’s brace and Ronaldo’s mysterious pre-game seizure, left Brazil reeling.<p> Nine Copas America —1919, 1922, 1949, 1989, 1997, 1999, 2004, 2007, and 2019—add layers to a legacy where every touch dances.",

                fullHighlight: "Germany’s football odyssey is a testament to precision, grit, and four World Cup crowns, bolstered by three Euros, forging a legacy of relentless excellence.<p> The 1954 ‘Miracle of Bern’ was their genesis: trailing Hungary’s Magical Magyars 2-0 in the final, West Germany staged a comeback for the ages. Helmut Rahn’s two goals—a slippery equalizer and a late winner—turned a 3-2 victory into a post-war rebirth, Fritz Walter’s leadership under Sepp Herberger toppling the invincible in the rain-soaked Swiss mud.<p> In 1974, hosting as West Germany, Franz Beckenbauer’s sweeper role redefined defending. Gerd Müller’s predatory swivel-and-strike in a 2-1 final win over Cruyff’s Netherlands—after a shock East German loss—proved their mettle, blending steel with swagger.<p> The 1990 title in Italy, amid reunification, was Beckenbauer’s managerial swan song: Andreas Brehme’s 85th-minute penalty sank Argentina 1-0 in Rome, avenging 1986’s defeat in a cagey, card-heavy clash.<p> The 2014 Brazil triumph was a modern epic: a 7-1 semi-final annihilation of the hosts—Miroslav Klose breaking Ronaldo’s record, Thomas Müller rampant—stunned the Maracanã, before Mario Götze’s extra-time volley (1-0) against Argentina under Joachim Löw’s vision showcased a new generation’s brilliance.<p> Runner-up scars run deep: 1966’s Wembley heartbreak against England (4-2), Geoff Hurst’s ghost goal off the bar still debated; 1982’s 3-1 loss to Italy after a penalty shootout thriller with France; 1986’s 3-2 defeat to Maradona’s Argentina; and 2002’s 2-0 shutout by Brazil’s Ronaldo.<p> Euros in 1972 (a 3-0 Soviet rout), 1980 (2-1 over Belgium), and 1996 (a Golden Goal against the Czechs) plus semi-final runs (2006, 2010) cement Germany as football’s enduring machine.",

Gino Colaussi and Silvio Piola’s braces demolished Hungary 4-2 in Paris, a display of flair atop their famed defense.<p> The 1982 Spain resurgence was Paolo Rossi’s redemption: banned for gambling, he erupted with six goals—a hat-trick against Brazil, a semi-final brace, and the opener in a 3-1 final win over West Germany—Dino Zoff, at 40, lifting the cup in Madrid.<p> The 2006 Germany title rose from Calciopoli’s ashes: Fabio Grosso’s semi-final screamer against the hosts and his shootout clincher against France—after Zidane’s headbutt exit—secured a 5-3 penalty win post a 1-1 draw, Marco Materazzi’s equalizer pivotal.<p> Runner-up wounds linger: 1970’s 4-1 Mexico final loss to Brazil’s samba kings, outclassed after an extra-time collapse; and 1994’s USA heartbreak, a 0-0 draw with Brazil ending in a 3-2 shootout loss—Baggio’s skyward miss a haunting image.<p> Euros in 1968 (a replayed 2-0 over Yugoslavia) and 2020 (penalties over England at Wembley) round out a tale where Italy thrives in chaos.",
